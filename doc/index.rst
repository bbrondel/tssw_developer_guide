This page contains general procedures and guidelines adopted by the Telescope and Site Software (TSSW) team.
It serves as reference for the work done during construction, and future operations, of the Vera Rubin Observatory control software.

The guide is devided in two main sessions:

   This is probably the best starting point for new contributors to understand how to cooperate with the software team.

* :ref:`Guidelines`
